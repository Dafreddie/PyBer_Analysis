# PyBer Analysis

### Overview: 
I was hired as an analysis for PyBer, a Python based ride sharing app company. My first assignment was an exploratory analysis on data in some very large csv files. To help in the process I need to create several types of visualizations to tell a compelling story about the data. I needed to write Python scripts using the Panda's libraries, the Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city, the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. The analysis and visualizations that I produced will help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. V. Isualize gave me and my coworker Omar a new assignment afterwards to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then using data visualization tools that I used earlier, asked if I would create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

### Results:
As we look at the data from the different city types and the conclusion that can be drawn from the data its fair to say that there is a huge difference in the way that the data is drawn. As expected there is more usage of PyBer in Urban cities. Most likely due to the higher population, as well as other factors such as tourism. When we compare the other two city types the usage decreases significantly. With Suburban communities using Pyber at less then half that of the Urban cities, and the rural areas are 1/10 of that compared to urban cities. 

#### Total Ride Count by City:

When we look at the total driver count the same thing happens. Except there is even more of a dramatic reduction in numbers going from Urban communities to Rural areas. As illustrated below:

#### Total Driver Count by City:

Overall we see that the amount of drivers and ride counts decrease as we get to rural type areas. Yet there is also a significant increase in the average cost of rides that are used in the rural areas. Most likely due to the distance of their trips as well as the layout of the towns or cities that they live in due to the lower populations. But that is merely speculation. What is clear is that the rural communities are paying at least 10%-60% more in comparison to that of the urban cities.

### Summary:
I would recommend these for the CEO to look at to address for the disparities among the city types
1. Charge a different rate for those in rural type cities compared to those in urban cities.
2. Run extra promotions in rural areas to increase the amount of people using PyBer as a whole.
3. The best time to run promotions would be at the end of February where there is a spike in the fare rates. Giving promotions during the influx of prices rising is a good deterrent from people discontinuing using PyBer.
